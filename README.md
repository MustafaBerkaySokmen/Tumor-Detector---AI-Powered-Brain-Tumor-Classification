# Tumor-Detector---AI-Powered-Brain-Tumor-Classification
This project is an AI-based medical image classification system that detects the presence of brain tumors in MRI scans. It uses image processing techniques to clean, preprocess, and categorize images, preparing them for further use in deep learning-based tumor detection models.
